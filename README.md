# Smart-thermostat
This project is the smart thermostat-based fault correction strategies

In this project, we employed the two-way OpenAPI functionality provided by the thermostat product to develop self correction algorithms. The algorithms include inefficient HVAC setpoints, schedules, and deadbands, which have been tested using EMIS tools.
